# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I didn't really code today because I've learned the text editor Vim.

**Thoughts:** I'm still really struggling with the ton of commands available and I'm not really fast at navigating in documents yet, but I feel like it's a really powerful tool so I will continue to practice coding on Vim.

### Day 2: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced using Vim again, and discovered about the "Vim Adventures" game which has been really helpful.

**Thoughts:** Vim looks like an amazing text editor but I feel like I shouldn't focus on learning Vim now because it's really time consuming.

### Day 4: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've followed a tutorial to learn how to properly use #Git with the terminal in UNIX. I've also kept on practicing manipulating DOM objects with JS.
