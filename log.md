# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I didn't really code today because I've learned the text editor Vim.

**Thoughts:** I'm still really struggling with the ton of commands available and I'm not really fast at navigating in documents yet, but I feel like it's a really powerful tool so I will continue to practice coding on Vim.

### Day 2: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced using Vim again, and discovered about the "Vim Adventures" game which has been really helpful.

**Thoughts:** Vim looks like an amazing text editor but I feel like I shouldn't focus on learning Vim now because it's really time consuming.
 
### Day 3: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced manipulating HTML objects with the DOM API, using methods of the document object like getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector() and querySelectorAll(). I've also reviewed arrays and how to display every items using a "for" loop.
