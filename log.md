# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I didn't really code today because I've learned the text editor Vim.

**Thoughts:** I'm still really struggling with the ton of commands available and I'm not really fast at navigating in documents yet, but I feel like it's a really powerful tool so I will continue to practice coding on Vim.

### Day 2: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced using Vim again, and discovered about the "Vim Adventures" game which has been really helpful.

**Thoughts:** Vim looks like an amazing text editor but I feel like I shouldn't focus on learning Vim now because it's really time consuming.
 
### Day 3: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced manipulating HTML objects with the DOM API, using methods of the document object like getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector() and querySelectorAll(). I've also reviewed arrays and how to display every items using a "for" loop.

### Day 4: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've followed a tutorial to learn how to properly use #Git with the terminal in UNIX. I've also kept on practicing manipulating DOM objects with JS.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy using the terminal.

### Day 5: December 31, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I did nothing ! Also, good bye 2018.

### Day 6: January 1st, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Studied the DOM API in JS. 

### Day 7: January 2, 2019
**Today's Progress**: First day of school at the 3wa, Paris France. We've studied basic HTML and CSS. Nothing new for me so far.

### Day 8: January 3, 2019
**Today's Progress**: We have practiced integrating a simple design with different fonts using the @font-face property.

### Day 9: January 4, 2019
**Today's Progress**: At school we've studied the float property.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting because I've never used the float property besides the "text wrapping an image" feature. I have to remember the "empty div with clear" trick. 

### Day 10: January 5, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I've just revised everything we did at school this week.

### Day 11: January 6, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I've practiced 8kyu challenges on CodeWars.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit frustrating but also exciting. I have to learn more about JS native methods.

## Day 12: January 7, 2019
**Today's Progress**: At school we've studied the inline-block property in CSS.**Thoughts**: I have to remember to use the vertical align. And also negative margins to get an element out of a block. Very useful !
