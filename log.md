# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: December 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I didn't really code today because I've learned the text editor Vim.

**Thoughts:** I'm still really struggling with the ton of commands available and I'm not really fast at navigating in documents yet, but I feel like it's a really powerful tool so I will continue to practice coding on Vim.

## Day 2: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced using Vim again, and discovered about the "Vim Adventures" game which has been really helpful.

**Thoughts:** Vim looks like an amazing text editor but I feel like I shouldn't focus on learning Vim now because it's really time consuming.
 
## Day 3: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced manipulating HTML objects with the DOM API, using methods of the document object like getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector() and querySelectorAll(). I've also reviewed arrays and how to display every items using a "for" loop.

## Day 4: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've followed a tutorial to learn how to properly use #Git with the terminal in UNIX. I've also kept on practicing manipulating DOM objects with JS.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy using the terminal.

## Day 5: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did nothing ! Also, good bye 2018.

## Day 9: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we've studied the float property.

**Today's Progress**: I've just revised everything we did at school this week.

## Day 11: January 6, 2019

## Day 12: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we've studied the inline-block property in CSS.**Thoughts**: I have to remember to use the vertical align. And also negative margins to get an element out of a block. Very useful !

## Day 13: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we've practiced creating simple layouts with float and display:inline-block. We've also learned about box-sizing properties and the normalize.css standard.

At school we've studied tables and forms in HTML/CSS, and also attributes selectors. We'll start JS tomorrow !

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday at school we have studied events listeners in JS.

## Day 27, January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today at school we made a slider using vanilla JS. I'm kinda proud of this one because this is the first actually useful thing I've made with js ! I still have moments like "What, is it really allowed to do that is JS ? Oh yeah it works."

## Day 28, January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we've seen animations in CSS. For now, I feel more stimulated when I'm studying back-end dev.

**Today's Progress**: At school, we've finally studied flex-box.

## Day 30, January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced using VIM. I'm not like these vim wizards who can transcend time and space with a text editor yet, but it's getting easier and easier to use it !

**Today's Progress**: practiced exercises on associative arrays in JS.

## Day 32, January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we had to make a HTML/CSS layout with flexbox. At home I've been studying about associative arrays in JS and the limit between objects and arrays in JS seems very blurry to me. I'm a bit confused...

## Day 33, January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday we had to make a static website for a fake company at school. I haven't finished yet. And I can't believe I'm already at 1/3 of the 100DaysOfCode challenge !

**Today's Progress**: D36: 2nd day of PHP at school. We've learned to manipulate arrays with some native PHP functions, and now we have to make a simple to-do list program. We'll be able to finish it on tuesday at school but I want to finish it this week-end.

## Day 37, February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: D37: Week-end ! A friend needed some help on his website so we've started coding sliding pictures with #JS ! That was really fun.

## Day 38, February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my day making a to-do list with PHP. Got stuck a long time on figuring out how to parse my csv file into a multidimensional array. [Stack Overflow got my back though](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54506304/how-to-parse-a-csv-file-into-a-multidimensional-array-in-php)

## Day 39, February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time perfecting my first PHP and Csv to-do list ! I've learned a lot from the official_php documentation that I find both very complete and crystal clear. I'd like to translate some articles in French someday.

## Day 40, February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: We had a power failure at school so I went back home to work. I've studied SQL basics and downloaded mycli, an amazing terminal client for MySQL I didn't know about ! http://mycli.net 

## Day 41, February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: At school we've studied SQL. I like the graphic representation of tables in PHPmyadmin, but I find the terminal way faster for typing queries.

## Day 42, February 7, 2019

## Day 48, February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: We've studied the very basics of jQuery at school. I wanted to wait a bit to be more fluent on JS before digging in jQuery, but I have to admit that it makes the manipulation of the DOM really easy. I'm a bit confused by the syntax sometimes though.

## Day 49, February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: We've started studying AJAX (or should I say AJAJ ?) with Json !

## Day 50, February 15, 2019
