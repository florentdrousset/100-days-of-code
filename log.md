# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I didn't really code today because I've learned the text editor Vim.

**Thoughts:** I'm still really struggling with the ton of commands available and I'm not really fast at navigating in documents yet, but I feel like it's a really powerful tool so I will continue to practice coding on Vim.
